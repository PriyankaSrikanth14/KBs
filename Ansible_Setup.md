# Ansible Setup

[Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-node-requirements)

## Pre-requisites:

Ansible can be run from any machine with Python 2 (version 2.7) or Python 3 (versions 3.5 and higher) installed. Red Hat, Debian, CentOS, macOS, any of the BSDs, and all *nix machines can be used as Controll Node. 

<b>Note</b>: <i> <b>Windows</b> is not supported for the control node </i>.

While, Ansible can be run from any machine including laptops, it is recommended to run a system that is close to the systems that are being managed. For instance, if the machines you want to manage are in aws, it's good to run from aws itself and so with Azure or any cloud provider

## Installation

### Debian Family

Including Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Kali etc

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible

cd ./ansible
make rpm
sudo rpm -Uvh ./rpm-build/ansible-*.noarch.rpm
